## Project Description
WasteNot is a personalized web application for anyone who is interested in monitoring and/or reducing their food waste. The application tracks a person’s daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and all-time food waste, calculating the total carbon emitted by each unit of food wasted. By doing so we will help reduce the individual's carbon footprint.


## Protoype Summary
We have implemented a way to store people's daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and all time food waste. We have been able to calculate an individual's carbon footprint from that data. We have also structured our code to be able to reset a person’s daily carbon footprint every day, weekly carbon footprint every week, monthly carbon footprint every month, and yearly carbon footprint every year so the user always has their most up-to-date progress In the future, we would like to increase the different types of food we can account for and provide helpful messages that suggest how to reduce food waste given an individual's food waste data.

## Next Steps

- App Deployment 
- One corner case we would like to improve upon is being able to keep someone's weekly progress if December 31st of one year and January 1st of the other year are in the same week. For example, if December 31st is a Wednesday and January 1st is a Thursday, they are in the same week.
- We want to allow user to add food items if they are not in our database.
- Provide Login 
- Add Other features to Home Dashboard like listing Top 3 items wasted 
- implement features which describing the effect of composting the food items or donating the food items
